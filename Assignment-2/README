<kernel.py> is actual virus code 

what i had done there is that used hash value of filename as start and end of virus code
which allows us to check whether the file is already infected or not then to infect 
files present in directories i used a os.walk() method which gives the files present 
in subdirectoories also then read the file and calculate the hash value of filename 
if it is present in file then file is already infected else infect the file as
1]<hash of filename>
2]<key for encryption/decryption>
3]<virus code>//Encrypted with the above key
4]<hash of filename>
5]<decryption mechnaism>
most importantly as given in assignment we need to write a polymorphic code 
that is each time when replicate itself into some other file then the code must be 
encrypted and these encryption string is also diffrent for each time these we achieve with
help of diffrent key each time and what will do we will add these key in file itself
such that it can be easy to decrypt it again while it is doing replication

so these is how i had written the code in python for the virus
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
now for antivirus file name is <antivirus.py> and it uses one other file called <status.csv>
two techniques i had used signature based  and heuristic based

<Signature based>
as it is obvious that decryption routine is in plain text in files therefore
it can act as good signature 
like i used signatures as <hash,encrypt,decrypt,key,exec,compress,decompress>
also after decryption it is common that we called the exec system call therefore
it is also included in signature also sometimes compression and decompression is also there
therefore they are also in signature list
that's how the signature are made
now we go throug \h each file and check whether any sugnature is present in file 
if yes then we will print it as threat file

<heuristic>
in heuristics based mechanism i used file meta info like file size 
it last modifiesd time and store that value in csv file 
while scannignif we found that file meta info has changed like sie of last 
modified time then announce it as threat file
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are some other files also i had zipped but those are my attempts while writing these
code
